    "## Observation and Interpretation\n",
    "Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.61 (61%). This means it correctly predicted the outcome for about 6 out of 10 patients, which is only slightly better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix:\n",

    "False Positives: 5 (Healthy patients wrongly labeled as sick)\n",

    "False Negatives: 16 (Sick patients wrongly labeled as healthy)\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positives: 5 (Sick patients correctly identified)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Issue (Recall): The recall for Class 1 (Heart Disease) is very low at 0.24. This means the model only detected 24% of the actual heart disease cases. It missed 16 out of 21 sick patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion: \n",
    "The high number of false negatives and the flat sigmoid curve suggest that Cholesterol alone is a poor predictor of heart disease. There is too much overlap between healthy and sick patients on this single feature to draw a clear decision boundary."

    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing: Feature Scaling\n",
    "Because we are combining features with vastly different ranges (e.g., \"Cholesterol\" is ~250, while \"Sex\" is 0 or 1), one feature could overpower the others mathematically.\n",

    "* Task 1 (Cholesterol Only): Accuracy 61%.\n",
    "* Task 2 (All Features): Accuracy 91%.\n",
    "* Why: Heart disease is a complex biological condition. It is not caused by a single factor like cholesterol. By providing the model with a holistic view of the patient (including Chest Pain Type, Exercise Angina, and EKG results), the algorithm could draw a much more precise decision boundary to separate healthy and sick patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. How does adding more features affect Accuracy and Recall?\n",
    "Adding features caused a drastic improvement in both metrics, specifically correcting the recall problem from Task 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Task 1 (Single Feature) | Task 2 (All Features) | Impact |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| Accuracy | 0.61 (61%) | 0.91 (91%) | +30% increase. The model is far less likely to guess randomly. |\n",
    "| Recall | 0.24 (24%) | 0.86 (86%) | Critical Improvement. In Task 1, we missed 76% of sick patients. In Task 2, we successfully identified the vast majority (18/21) of them. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Trade-offs between Interpretability and Performance\n",
    "There is often a conflict between how easy a model is to understand versus how well it works.\n",
    "* Task 1 (High Interpretability, Low Performance):\n",
    "    * We could easily plot this on a 2D graph (Sigmoid curve) and visually see the relationship.\n",
    "    * Trade-off: While easy to explain (\"Lower your cholesterol\"), the model was too simple to be useful in the real world.\n",
    "* Task 2 (Low Interpretability, High Performance):\n",
    "    * We cannot visualize this easily because it exists in 13-dimensional space. We rely on metrics (Accuracy/Recall) rather than visual curves to trust it.\n",
    "    * Trade-off: We lose the ability to draw a simple picture, but we gain a high level of accuracy. In medical diagnostics, performance (high Recall) is almost always prioritized over visual simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Final Conclusion\n",
    "Using only cholesterol was not enough to accurately diagnose patients. However, when we included all health features, the accuracy jumped to 91%. This proves that using the full patient profile helps predict heart disease much more reliably."
